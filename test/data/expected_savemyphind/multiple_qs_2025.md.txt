why is rad(2) irrational

## AI answer
The square root of 2 (âˆš2) is irrational because it cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. This can be proven through a proof by contradiction:

1.  Assume âˆš2 is rational, so it can be written as a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors [1](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/euclid-square-root-2-irrational.html) [2](https://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/proof_square_root_2_irrational.php).
2.  Square both sides: 2 = aÂ²/bÂ²
3.  Multiply both sides by bÂ²: 2bÂ² = aÂ²
4.  Since aÂ² is even, a must be even. Let a = 2k where k is an integer [1](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/euclid-square-root-2-irrational.html) [2](https://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/proof_square_root_2_irrational.php).
5.  Substitute a = 2k into 2bÂ² = aÂ²: 2bÂ² = (2k)Â² = 4kÂ²
6.  Simplify: bÂ² = 2kÂ²
7.  Since bÂ² is even, b must be even [1](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/euclid-square-root-2-irrational.html) [2](https://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/proof_square_root_2_irrational.php).
8.  This contradicts the initial assumption that a and b have no common factors, as both are even [1](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/euclid-square-root-2-irrational.html) [2](https://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/proof_square_root_2_irrational.php).

Therefore, the original assumption that âˆš2 is rational must be false, proving that âˆš2 is irrational [1](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/euclid-square-root-2-irrational.html) [2](https://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/proof_square_root_2_irrational.php) [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2). This proof demonstrates that if âˆš2 were rational, it would lead to an infinite descent of simplification, which is impossible for rational numbers [1](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/euclid-square-root-2-irrational.html) [3](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/square-root-2-irrational.html). The irrationality of âˆš2 is a fundamental concept in mathematics, first discovered by ancient Greek mathematicians [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2).

what other irrational nums are there

## AI answer
In addition to âˆš2, there are many other irrational numbers. Some notable examples include:

1.  Ï€ (pi) = 3.14159265... [1](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/) [4](https://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html)
2.  e (Euler's number) = 2.7182818... [1](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/) [4](https://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html)
3.  âˆš3 = 1.73205080... [1](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/)
4.  âˆš5 = 2.23606797... [1](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/)
5.  âˆš7 = 2.64575131... [1](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/)
6.  âˆš11 = 3.31662479... [1](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/)
7.  âˆš13 = 3.60555127... [1](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/)
8.  The golden ratio (Ï†) = 1.61803398... [4](https://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html) [6](https://www.dreambox.com/math/skills/numbers/irrational-numbers)

Other irrational numbers include:

*   Square roots of non-perfect squares (e.g., âˆš2, âˆš3, âˆš5, âˆš8) [1](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/)
*   Cube roots of non-perfect cubes [4](https://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html)
*   The square root of any prime number (e.g., âˆš2, âˆš3, âˆš5, âˆš7, âˆš11, âˆš13) [1](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/)
*   Many transcendental numbers, which are irrational numbers that are not algebraic [6](https://www.dreambox.com/math/skills/numbers/irrational-numbers)

It's important to note that there are infinitely many irrational numbers, and they make up the majority of real numbers [3](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:irrational-numbers/x2f8bb11595b61c86:irrational-numbers-intro/v/introduction-to-rational-and-irrational-numbers). In fact, any non-repeating, non-terminating decimal is an irrational number [5](https://www.learner.com/blog/what-is-an-irrational-number-in-math).

whats the difference between a rational and irrational number

## AI answer
The key difference between rational and irrational numbers lies in their representation and decimal expansion: Rational numbers:

1.  Can be expressed as a ratio of two integers (p/q form, where q â‰  0) [1](https://byjus.com/maths/difference-between-rational-and-irrational-numbers/) [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number)
2.  Have decimal expansions that either terminate or repeat [1](https://byjus.com/maths/difference-between-rational-and-irrational-numbers/) [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number)
3.  Include all integers, fractions, and repeating decimals [9](https://www.mometrix.com/academy/rational-numbers/)

Irrational numbers:

1.  Cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers [1](https://byjus.com/maths/difference-between-rational-and-irrational-numbers/) [3](https://www.dreambox.com/math/skills/numbers/irrational-numbers)
2.  Have decimal expansions that are non-terminating and non-repeating [1](https://byjus.com/maths/difference-between-rational-and-irrational-numbers/) [3](https://www.dreambox.com/math/skills/numbers/irrational-numbers)
3.  Include numbers like Ï€, e, âˆš2, and the golden ratio (Ï†) [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number) [6](https://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html)

Examples:

*   Rational: 3/4 = 0.75 (terminating), 1/3 = 0.333... (repeating) [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number)
*   Irrational: Ï€ = 3.14159... (non-terminating, non-repeating) [6](https://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html)

In essence, rational numbers can be written as exact fractions, while irrational numbers cannot be represented as simple fractions and have infinite, non-repeating decimal expansions [9](https://www.mometrix.com/academy/rational-numbers/).
